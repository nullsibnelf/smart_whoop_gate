open source hardware - Smart Gate for microcopter like Tiny Whoop


Goals:

- open amount of gates on track, that communicate with each over    
    
- detects copter flyover and changes color for visual feedback    
- detection via rssi of the fpv-camera signal of the copter    
- acoustic feedback on first gate of the parcour    
- only the active gate is green, all other red    
    
- first gate tracks roundtimes, output via serial connection (could be extendet to bluetooth or wifi)    
    
- running on LiPo18650 with monitoring and warning of deep discharge    
- chargeable via micro-USB plug
